# Randomizer Note Clicker

### By Nakuri

This app allows you to take quick small notes entirely controllable by clicking/touch. This app is designed around specific Randomizers and use-cases such as for example FF4FE (Final Fantasy 4 Free Enterprise). For the initial release, it only supports Shop Tracking for FF4FE, but will be probably expanded to also support for example Entrance Notes for ALttPR Entrance Shuffle.

### How to Use

Open the app under the following url: [Randomizer Note Clicker](http://noteclicker-nakuri.com/) and select the Rando Note Clicker you wish to use. A popout window will appear and you can close the original page from which you launched the app. You can now use the Note Clicker to create your notes.

### Restrictions

This app is currently still in development and testing. So far it has been working under Chromium Browsers, as well as Firefox and Android. Safari on MacOS might block all popups, so you might have to adjust your settings to allow them for this website. The Randomizer Note Clicker works on mobile, but it's not officially supported, especially on older phones with smaller viewports.
